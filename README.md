# Jules Moynat Portfolio (Vue.js & Tailwind CSS)

## Project Goal

This project aims to create a modern, responsive, and interactive online portfolio for Jules Moynat, showcasing their work and professional profile. It will be built using Vue.js for dynamic content and Tailwind CSS for a utility-first styling approach.

## Features

- **Personal Bio & CV:** Comprehensive sections detailing studies, professional experience, talks, and musical mixes.
- **Content Toggle:** A mechanism to switch between the main bio/CV content and an interactive image gallery.
- **Interactive Image Gallery:**
  - Dynamically loaded images.
  - Randomized sizing and positioning of images.
  - Infinite scroll functionality for continuous image loading.
  - Clickable images with descriptive overlays.
  - Draggable images for user interaction.

## Key Technical Considerations

- **Technology Stack:** Vue.js for the frontend framework and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Setup and Development

### Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

### Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

### Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).
